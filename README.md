# ML-Diabetes-RapidMiner
Comprehensive collection of machine learning models tailored specifically for predicting and analyzing diabetes-related outcomes.

## RapidMiner 
RapidMiner provides data mining and machine learning procedures including: data loading and transformation (ETL), data preprocessing and visualization, predictive analytics and statistical modeling, evaluation, and deployment. RapidMiner is written in the Java programming language. RapidMiner provides a GUI to design and execute analytical workflows.

## Classification in Machine Learning 
> Classification is a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data. In classification, the model is fully trained using the training data, and then it is evaluated on test data before being used to perform prediction on new unseen data.

1. Select Attribute: This block allows me to select the specific attributes I will include in the analysis.
2. Set Role: This block allows you to specify the role of each attribute in your dataset, such as the target attribute (or variable to be predicted) and the input attributes. 
3. Split Data: This block is used to split the data set into training and test sets.
4. Apply Model: This block is used to apply the previously trained model to new data. 
5. Naive Bayes: This is a machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes conditional independence between attributes.
6. Performance: This block is used to evaluate the model's performance. It generally provides measures such as accuracy, precision, and other metrics to measure how well the model's predictions match the true target values.
